## Demo 

A quick look at machine learning on data set with turi &amp; generating a CoreML model. 
This model can be used in iOS apps powered by ARKit/Vision frameworks to identify images on the fly!

## Prerequisite:

* Python Version 2.7 - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads)

* Install Turi using the following command on Terminal

   ```$ pip install turicreate```



## Using ```mlmodel``` in iOS apps
